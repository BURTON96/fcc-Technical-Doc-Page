                <p>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous is the final installment in a trilogy of tutorials on Developer Fundamentals designed to 
                teach three skills essential for software developers and those who work with them.Its only prerequisites are the first two tutorials
                 in the trilogy, Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous (covering the Unix command line) and Learn Enough Text Editor to Be Dangerous (covering text editors).
                </p>
                <p>
                This tutorial covers a third essential skill: version control. As with its two predecessors, Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous
                 doesn’t even assume you’re familiar with the category of application, so if you’re unsure about what “version control” is, you’re in the
                  right place. Even if you are already familiar with the subject, it’s likely you’ll still learn a lot from this tutorial. Either way, learning the material in Learn 
                  Enough Git to Be Dangerous prepares you for the other Learn Enough tutorials while enabling an astonishing variety of applications—including a special surprise bonus at the end (Box 1.1).</p>
